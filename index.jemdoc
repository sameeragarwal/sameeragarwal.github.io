== 
I am a final year PhD student working with [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/ Prof. Ion Stoica] and [http://db.lcs.mit.edu/madden/ Prof. Sam Madden] on [http://blinkdb.cs.berkeley.edu BlinkDB], a database that guarantees sub-second query latencies on unbounded data by trading-off on the accuracy of results. In the recent past, I have also actively collaborated with [http://research.microsoft.com/~srikanth Dr. Srikanth Kandula] at [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/default.aspx Microsoft Research, Redmond] on [https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi12/reoptimizing-data-parallel-computing RoPE] (Re-Optimizer for Parallel Execution). RoPE optimizes parallel executions by leveraging a variety of runtime/intermediate data statistics and has been successfully deployed on production clusters at [http://www.bing.com Microsoft Bing]. I completed my undergraduate education from the [http://www.iitg.ernet.in/cse/ Department of Computer Science and Engineering] at the [http://www.iitg.ernet.in Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati] in 2009 and was awarded the prestigious [http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090530/jsp/northeast/story_11037207.jsp President of India Gold Medal].

I was supported by the [http://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship-2012 Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship] during 2012-13 and am supported by the [https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-academics/announcing-the-2013-2014-facebook-graduate-fellows/514353405282738 Facebook Graduate Fellowship] during 2013-14.
